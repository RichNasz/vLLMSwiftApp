# Understanding the Alamofire chat

Learn about implementing text chat functionality using Alamofire

## Overview

[Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) is an HTTP networking library written in Swift that is released under the MIT license. This article focuses on how the Alamofire library is used to interact with models served by vLLM using an OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

Alamofire project documentation can be accessed on the main GitHub page of the project. The OpenAI specification that this implementation follows can be found on the [OpenAI Platform website](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text?api-mode=responses).

>Important: You must have access to an OpenAI-compatible or Llama-Stack server (with OpenAI compatibility) for the implementation to connect. There are many providers of inference server with OpenAI-compatible endpoints. vLLM is one such inference server, and [documentation on how to implement an OpenAI-compatible endpoint](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/serving/openai_compatible_server.html) is available in the vLLM project documentation.

### User interface

The user interface for interacting with vLLM for inference using an OpenAI-endpoint via Alamofire is contained within ``AlamoFireChatView``. That view leverages a subview called ``ChatInputView`` that provides an API agnostic method for collecting the user prompt to send for inference. The MVVM model for ``AlamoFireChatView`` is contained within ``AlamoFireChatViewModel``.

``AlamoFireChatView`` is made visible by the ``MainAppView`` when the user selects the **Alamofire Chat** menu option from the main menu on the left sidebar of the app.

### Implementation details

The Alamofire implementation demonstrates several key features:

- **Streaming responses**: Uses Alamofire's streaming capabilities to process server-sent events (SSE) from the OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- **Real-time updates**: Leverages the `@Observable` macro for real-time UI updates as streaming content arrives
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling for HTTP status codes, API errors, and network issues
- **URL validation**: Automatic URL path correction (adds `/v1/chat/completions` if no path is provided)
- **JSON processing**: Handles the conversion between snake_case (OpenAI API) and camelCase (Swift conventions)

### Key components

The implementation includes several important structures:

- ``OpenAIRequest``: Represents the request payload sent to the OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- ``OpenAIMessage``: Represents individual messages in the conversation
- ``OpenAIStreamResponse``: Handles the streaming response format from the server
- ``OpenAIError`` and ``OpenAIErrorResponse``: Capture and process error responses from the API

### Testing

Swift Testing code for Alamofire functionality is located in the vLLMSwiftAppTests folder of the project. Currently test coverage includes:
- ``AlamoFireChatViewModel``
